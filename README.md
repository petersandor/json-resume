## My resume in JSON
I love the idea of storing pure data about my career like this. 
You can use various tools such as [resume-cli](https://github.com/jsonresume/resume-cli) or [HackMyResume](https://github.com/hacksalot/HackMyResume) to generate PDF, DOC, HTML  and who knows how many other formats. With custom themes! :sparkles:

Say no more to PDF, Photoshop or any other manual editing!
